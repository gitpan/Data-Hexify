Data-Hexify
===========

This module exports one subroutine: Hexify.

Hexify formats arbitrary (possible binary) data into a format suitable
for hex dumps in the style of xd or hexl.

The first, or only, argument to Hexify contains the data, or a
reference to the data, to be hexified. Hexify will return a string
that prints as follows:

  0000: 70 61 63 6b 61 67 65 20 44 61 74 61 3a 3a 48 65  package Data::He
  0010: 78 69 66 79 3b 0a 0a 75 73 65 20 35 2e 30 30 36  xify;..use 5.006

and so on. At the left is the (hexadecimal) index of the data, then a
number of hex bytes, followed by the chunk of data with unprintables
replaced by periods.

An optional second argument can be used to tailor the Hexify output to
your specific needs.

WHY

Why Data::Hexify when there is Data::HexDump and Data::Hexdumper?

Data::Hexify has a number of options not found in other hex dumpers:

  - Alignment of output lines;
  - Suppression of identical output lines;
  - User control over which characters are printable;
  - User control over the output width;
  - Fake indices;
  - Unicode resistant.

See the documentation for details.
